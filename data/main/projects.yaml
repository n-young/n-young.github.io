      content: |
          <p>
              Built a highly performant time-series database in Rust.
              Leverages boolean logic-based query optimization to achieve
              up to 250x speedup in query evaluation, bit-level compression
              on time series records, and finite-state transducers-based
              indexing strategies to remain time- and space-efficient for incredibly
              high cardinality data. Completed as part of a research project for
              CSCI 2270 - Managing and Mining Massive Time Series.

              Designed and built a static site generator that uses YAML and Markdown
              files to specify and generate the structure of the website. Supports
              partials, data injection, inline math, :joy:-like emojis, and much more.

      icon-alt: deepkart64-icon

          <p>
              Designed and implemented DeepKart64, a reinforcement
              learning model built to play Mario Kart 64 on the N64.
              Used a pre-build Mario Kart 64 OpenAI gym wrapper
              alongside Tensorflow to build the agent. The model
              utilized a convolutional encoder to interpret the visual
              game state and a REINFORCE with baseline model to
              determine actions and rewards.
          </p>
          <p>
              Completed as part of a final project for CSCI 1470 -
              Deep Learning at Brown University. Worked with three
              other team members. Primarily contributed to development
              setup, model tweaking, and command line integrations.

      icon-alt: droppy-icon
      content: |
          <p>
              Developed Droppy, a quick and easy way of sharing files
              securely. Simply upload a file, and optionally attach a
              note, an expiration date, or a password, then
              autogenerate a link to share the files with others!
          </p>
          <p>
              Implemented the front end in React. The back end was
              built with Rust using Rocket. Files are stored in AWS
              S3, metadata is stored seperately in MongoDB. Deployed
              on Netlify and GCP.

          <p>
              Built ParselTongue, an academic paper skimmer, as a
              final project for CSCI 0320 - Software Engineering. With
              just a few keywords, ParselTongue finds the most salient
              parts of academic papers to your described topics,
              saving countless hours of research.
          </p>
          <p>
              Implemented the front end using Freemarker templates,
              and used Java and Apache Spark for user validation,
              persistence, and data handling. Database was implemented
              in MongoDB. Back end relies on the PageRank algorithm to
              search PDFs for semantic covariance.

          <p>
              LinguaML is a computer-vision powered language learning
              app designed for on-the-go learners. With just a picture
              of your subject, flashcards for any language are
              generated within seconds and saved in the app. You can
              view, study, edit, and share flashcards with your
              friends!
          </p>
          <p>
              LinguaML was conceived and developed at Hack@Brown 2020.
              It won the Facebook award for "Best hack that builds
              community through private or small-group interaction".
